This ruby code provides a gui that loads TLEs into hardware running
the satpack code. It will also sync the realtime clock on board the 
satpack hardware. 

This code requires the following ruby libraries be installed:
open-uri
tempfile
serialport
wx

You can run 'gem install PACKAGENAME' to install these. On MacOS and Linux
you might want to do so as root using 'sudo gem install PACKAGENAME' For
some reason, wx is in a gem called 'wxruby'.

In addition, this code requires that the 'avrdude' commandline program
be installed, since it uses this to access the EEPROM on board the 
microcontroller. The easiest way to get this is to ensure you have an 
Arduino IDE installed, since it includes avrdude.

'serialport' is difficult to install on Win32 systems. I have included
instructions on my blog at http://ve9qrp.blogspot.com/2009/12/ruby-serialport-on-win32.html
This is enough of a hassle, that I intend to compile binaries on Win32.

On MacOS, the drag-and-drop code does not properly work, at least in my 
hand-compiled code for Snow Leopard and Ruby 1.8.6. I'm going to wait for
wxRuby 2.1 and Ruby 1.9 before I start to worry.
