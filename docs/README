The directories 'Ansiterm' 'CW' 'FT817' and 'Plan13' should 
be installed in your Arduino libraries directory, which usually
appears alongside your sketches.

Upon restarting the Arduino IDE, the example sketches provided for 
each of these libraries should be available under 'File/Examples'.
Some of these libraries have external dependencies. A simple google
search should find the needed library, which should also be installed
in your 'libraries' directory.
